# F those UFOs

I have too many UnFinished Objects around my house since starting my mission to be Katy the Dev. I feel a silly twinge of guilt if I'm spending free time doing anything but learning how to code. All typey no stitchy makes Katy quite bitchy.

F Those UFOs allows me to list projects I need to complete and have the satisfaction of knocking them off my list. 

Ironically, I am not doing any of them while I build this project.
